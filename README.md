# AI-Hack 
[Student Track]- AI for learning & Developing Productivity
An AI-powered system designed to transform student ambition into structured, consistent, and measurable progress.

## 🚩 Problem
Students struggle with fragmented tools for academics, skill development, and placements.  
Lack of structure, distractions, and low motivation lead to inconsistent outcomes.

Instead of giving more content, the platform builds systems that ensure progress.
